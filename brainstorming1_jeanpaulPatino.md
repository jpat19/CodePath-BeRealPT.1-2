# **Hello World**
Testing some ideas.

Make a list of your favorite apps and for each app, identify 2-3 features of that app that make it stand out. You'll return to this document during the next capstone session! Each team member should add 3 to 5 mutually exclusive apps (two team members can't list the same app).

My favorite apps: 

**1. Tik Tok**
* Its easy-to-use editing features and effects encourage creativity, and its algorithmic recommendation system guarantees a customized content stream based on user preferences, all of which add to its popularity and quick expansion.
* TikTok distinguishes itself with its short-form video format, which enables users to quickly produce interesting material.
    
**2. Youtube**
* With a big and varied content collection that appeals to a wide variety of interests, YouTube stands out.
* Through comments, likes, and shares, its dynamic creative community encourages participation, and its monetization options enable artists to make a living off of their love.

**3. Twitter**
* Hashtags are used to structure conversations, and popular subjects draw attention to ongoing worldwide debates.
* By allowing content amplification, the retweet function makes Twitter a vibrant medium for the exchange of ideas and news.
